The goal of this lab was to learn how to perform basic configuration tasks on Cisco routers and switches using the command-line interface (CLI). I practiced setting hostnames, enabling interfaces, assigning IP addresses, and securing devices with passwords. This lab helped me understand the foundational steps required to bring network devices online and ensure basic connectivity. Gaining confidence with initial configurations is essential for building more complex networks and supports my growth in both networking and cybersecurity roles.
